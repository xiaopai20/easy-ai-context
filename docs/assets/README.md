## README screenshots

This folder contains screenshots used by the project `README.md`.

Add these files (PNG) so the screenshots render on GitHub:

- `docs/assets/Gpt-read-context.png`
- `docs/assets/Gpt-save-context.png`
- `docs/assets/Gpt-continue-context.png`

Tip: you can use the screenshots from your local Cursor session (they were previously captured as files) and copy them into this folder using the filenames above.
